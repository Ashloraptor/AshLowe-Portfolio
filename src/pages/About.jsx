        After receiving my high school diploma in 2012, I attended San Antonio College and worked as a cashier in the fast food industry, as I pondered my choice in careers. In 2014, a door opened for me in technical support for AT&T, through a 3rd party contractor. I continued to work there until 2016, when I received a job offer from JPM Chase.

        I worked for JPM Chase in Fraud Protection and Tech Support for 7 years, until my job was rendered obsolete by AI. It was during my tenure at Chase that I discovered my passion for coding. As my job position no longer existed, I decided to take the opportunity to return to school and learn the additional skills I needed to be able to turn that passion into a career.</p>
        <p>
        Having completed my coding education (passing with 98.6%), I am now a full-stack certified, web developer, with over 7 years of experience in the tech support sector. Now, Iâ€™m looking for the right company with which to apply my skills, and grow together in the tech industry.
